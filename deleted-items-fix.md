# Deleted Items Fix - Test Results

## ✅ Issue Fixed: Deleted Items Now Using Real Data

### Problem Identified
The deleted items page was displaying hardcoded sample data instead of actual deleted tasks from the TaskService.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Updated DeletedItemsComponent (deleted-items.ts)**
- ✅ **Removed hardcoded data**: Eliminated the sample deleted tasks array
- ✅ **Connected to TaskService**: Now properly injects and uses TaskService
- ✅ **Real data getter**: Added `get deletedTasks()` that filters actual deleted tasks
- ✅ **Proper restore functionality**: `restoreTask()` now calls `taskService.restore()`
- ✅ **Permanent delete**: Now properly removes tasks from the service
- ✅ **Router integration**: Uses Angular Router instead of NavigationService

#### 2. **Updated Template (deleted-items.html)**
- ✅ **Removed loading state**: No longer needed since data is reactive
- ✅ **Updated data binding**: Uses real Task model properties
- ✅ **Corrected date display**: Shows `createdAt` instead of non-existent `deletedAt`
- ✅ **Task status display**: Shows whether task was completed or active

#### 3. **Updated Styles (deleted-items.css)**
- ✅ **Removed loading spinner**: Cleaned up unused styles
- ✅ **Modern design**: Updated to match the tasks page styling
- ✅ **Responsive layout**: Optimized for mobile and desktop

### How It Now Works

1. **Data Source**: Gets deleted tasks from `TaskService.filter(true, 'all').filter(task => task.deleted)`
2. **Real-time Updates**: Uses reactive getter so changes are immediately reflected
3. **Restore Functionality**: Calls `taskService.restore(id)` which sets `deleted: false`
4. **Permanent Delete**: Removes tasks entirely from the service using `tasks.update()`
5. **Persistence**: All changes are automatically saved to localStorage via TaskService

### Test Workflow

1. **Add tasks** on the main tasks page
2. **Delete some tasks** using the delete buttons
3. **Navigate to deleted items** - you'll see the actual deleted tasks
4. **Restore tasks** - they reappear on the main tasks page
5. **Permanently delete** - tasks are removed completely

### Bundle Impact
- **Deleted items chunk**: Reduced from 33.54 kB to 26.94 kB (more efficient code)
- **Tasks chunk**: Slightly reduced from 32.24 kB to 29.71 kB
- **Better performance**: No more setTimeout delays or loading states

## ✅ Status: FIXED

The deleted items page now correctly displays actual deleted tasks and integrates seamlessly with the task management system. All functionality works as expected with real data persistence.

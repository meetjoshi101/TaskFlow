## July 25, 2025: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

TaskFlow will be positioned as a comprehensive SaaS project management platform specifically designed for development teams, focusing on unified multi-level planning (project → sprint → daily) with intelligent automation and real-time collaboration features.

**Target Market:** Small to medium-sized development teams (5-50 members) and growing startups
**Key Differentiators:** Unified planning across time horizons, intelligent dependency management, AI-assisted estimation
**Core Value Proposition:** Reduce planning overhead by 50% while improving alignment between strategy and execution

### Context

Current project management tools in the market suffer from several key limitations:
- **Fragmentation:** Teams use different tools for different planning levels (roadmap tools, sprint planning, daily task management)
- **Poor Integration:** Existing tools don't effectively connect strategic goals to daily work
- **Manual Overhead:** Too much time spent on administrative tasks rather than value creation
- **Limited Intelligence:** Most tools are passive repositories rather than intelligent assistants

Market opportunity exists because:
- Remote/hybrid work has increased demand for better digital collaboration tools
- Development teams are growing in size and complexity
- Existing solutions (Jira, Asana, Linear) have significant gaps in multi-level planning integration
- AI/ML capabilities can now provide meaningful assistance in planning and estimation

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Enterprise-focused Platform (competing with Jira/Azure DevOps)**
   - Pros: Larger market size, higher revenue per customer, established buying patterns
   - Cons: Long sales cycles, complex feature requirements, established competition, high development complexity

2. **Simple Task Management Tool (competing with Todoist/Things)**
   - Pros: Faster to market, simpler development, clearer value proposition
   - Cons: Crowded market, limited differentiation, lower revenue potential, doesn't solve team coordination

3. **Vertical-specific Solution (e.g., only for software development)**
   - Pros: Clear target market, specific feature set, easier to build integrations
   - Cons: Limited market size, dependency on single industry, harder to expand

### Rationale

The chosen approach balances market opportunity with development feasibility:

**Market Positioning:** SMB development teams represent a sweet spot with clear pain points, reasonable buying power, and less entrenched tool preferences than enterprises.

**Technical Approach:** Building on modern web technologies (Angular, Node.js, PostgreSQL) provides scalability while keeping development complexity manageable.

**Feature Prioritization:** Focus on planning intelligence and multi-level integration creates clear differentiation from existing tools without requiring extensive feature parity.

**Go-to-Market:** Developer-friendly pricing and bottom-up adoption strategy reduces customer acquisition costs compared to enterprise sales.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear product differentiation in a growing market
- Technical architecture supports both current needs and future scaling
- Development roadmap provides clear value delivery milestones
- Target market has established willingness to pay for productivity tools

**Negative:**
- Will require significant AI/ML development investment in Phase 2
- Success depends on achieving network effects within development teams
- Competition from well-funded incumbents (Atlassian, Microsoft) is inevitable
- Need to balance feature richness with simplicity for SMB market

## July 25, 2025: Technical Architecture Decision

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

TaskFlow will use a modern web application architecture with Angular frontend, Node.js/Express backend, PostgreSQL database, and Socket.io for real-time features, hosted on Digital Ocean infrastructure.

### Context

Technology choices need to support:
- Real-time collaboration features
- Complex data relationships (projects, sprints, tasks, dependencies)
- Future AI/ML feature integration
- Team development velocity
- Scalability to thousands of users

### Rationale

**Angular:** Provides robust framework for complex application state management, excellent TypeScript support, and team familiarity.
**Node.js/Express:** Enables full-stack JavaScript development, excellent ecosystem for real-time features, fast development iteration.
**PostgreSQL:** Robust relational database suitable for complex queries and data integrity requirements.
**Socket.io:** Proven solution for real-time features with fallback support and scalability options.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Consistent technology stack reduces context switching
- Strong ecosystem support for all chosen technologies
- Clear scaling path for all components

**Negative:**
- Single programming language creates potential skill bottleneck
- Real-time features add infrastructure complexity from day one

# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-user-auth-team-management/spec.md

> Created: July 25, 2025
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Security
- **Password Hashing:** bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds for secure password storage
- **JWT Implementation:** Access tokens (15-minute expiry) + Refresh tokens (7-day expiry) for session management
- **Email Verification:** Cryptographically secure tokens with 24-hour expiration for account activation
- **Password Reset:** Secure token-based password reset with 1-hour expiration and single-use enforcement

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Team Isolation:** Row-level security ensuring complete data isolation between teams
- **Unique Identifiers:** UUID-based team and user IDs to prevent enumeration attacks
- **Database Design:** Tenant-aware queries with team_id foreign keys on all major entities
- **Session Context:** JWT tokens include team context for request-level tenant identification

### API Security & Validation
- **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation using express-validator for all endpoints
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on auth endpoints (5 attempts per minute for login)
- **CORS Configuration:** Restrict origins to approved domains in production
- **Request Sanitization:** XSS protection and SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Frontend Requirements
- **Angular Guards:** Route guards preventing unauthorized access to protected pages
- **State Management:** NgRx store for authentication state with persistent session handling
- **Form Validation:** Real-time client-side validation with server-side confirmation
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages with proper feedback for auth failures

## Approach Options

**Option A: Session-Based Authentication**
- Pros: Simple to implement, built-in Express session support, secure server-side storage
- Cons: Not ideal for SPA applications, harder to scale across multiple servers, CSRF concerns

**Option B: JWT Token Authentication** (Selected)
- Pros: Stateless, ideal for SPA/API architecture, scalable across servers, mobile-friendly
- Cons: Token revocation complexity, requires proper refresh token management

**Option C: Hybrid Session + JWT**
- Pros: Combines benefits of both approaches, very secure
- Cons: Increased complexity, potential performance overhead

**Rationale:** JWT authentication aligns with TaskFlow's SPA architecture and future mobile plans. The access/refresh token pattern provides security while maintaining usability. This approach scales well with the planned real-time features and microservices architecture.

## External Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies
- **bcrypt** (`^5.1.0`) - Industry-standard password hashing library
- **Justification:** Most secure and widely-adopted password hashing solution for Node.js

- **jsonwebtoken** (`^9.0.0`) - JWT creation and verification
- **Justification:** De facto standard for JWT handling in Node.js ecosystem

- **express-validator** (`^7.0.0`) - Request validation middleware
- **Justification:** Comprehensive validation with sanitization capabilities

- **nodemailer** (`^6.9.0`) - Email sending for verification and password reset
- **Justification:** Robust email library with support for multiple transport methods

- **express-rate-limit** (`^6.7.0`) - Rate limiting middleware
- **Justification:** Essential for protecting authentication endpoints from brute force attacks

### Frontend Dependencies
- **@angular/forms** (Built-in) - Reactive forms for registration/login
- **@ngrx/store** (`^16.0.0`) - State management for authentication state
- **@ngrx/effects** (`^16.0.0`) - Side effects management for API calls

## Database Performance Considerations

- **Indexing Strategy:** Create composite indexes on (email, team_id) and (team_id, role) for efficient queries
- **Connection Pooling:** Configure Sequelize with appropriate connection pool settings for concurrent users
- **Query Optimization:** Use eager loading for user-team relationships to minimize N+1 queries

## Security Implementation Details

### Password Policy
- Minimum 8 characters with complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number)
- Password strength indicator on frontend registration form
- Prevention of common passwords using a blacklist check

### Session Management
- Automatic logout after 7 days of inactivity
- Concurrent session handling (allow multiple devices)
- Secure logout with token blacklisting for security-sensitive operations

### Email Security
- DKIM signing for outbound verification emails
- Email template sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting on email sending (max 3 verification emails per hour per user)

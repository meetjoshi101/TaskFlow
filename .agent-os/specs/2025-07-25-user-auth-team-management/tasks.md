## Task Dependencies

- **Task 2** depends on Task 1 (database models must exist before API implementation)
- **Task 3** depends on Task 1 and Task 2 (team management needs auth infrastructure)
- **Task 4** can be developed in parallel with Tasks 2-3 but integrates with both
- **Task 5** depends on Task 2 (frontend auth needs working API endpoints)
- **Task 6** depends on Tasks 3 and 5 (team management UI needs both auth and team APIs)
- **Task 7** depends on all previous tasks (integration testing requires complete system)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Task 1:** 3-4 days (database foundation)
- **Task 2:** 4-5 days (core authentication API)
- **Task 3:** 3-4 days (team management API)
- **Task 4:** 2-3 days (email service integration)
- **Task 5:** 4-5 days (frontend authentication)
- **Task 6:** 3-4 days (team management UI)
- **Task 7:** 2-3 days (security and integration testing)

**Total Estimated Time:** 21-28 days (approximately 4-6 weeks depending on team size and parallel development)

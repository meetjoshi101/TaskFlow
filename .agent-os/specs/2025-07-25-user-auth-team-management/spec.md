# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: User Authentication & Team Management
> Created: July 25, 2025
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive multi-tenant authentication system with team management capabilities that enables secure user registration, login, and team collaboration for TaskFlow's project management platform. This foundational feature will support the platform's collaborative nature by allowing teams to organize, invite members, and manage access controls across projects.

## User Stories

### Team Administrator Registration & Setup

As a team administrator, I want to create a new TaskFlow account and set up my team workspace, so that I can begin organizing my development team's project management workflow.

**Workflow:** User visits TaskFlow landing page, clicks "Sign Up", completes registration form with team details, verifies email address, and is guided through initial team setup including team name, basic settings, and optional team member invitations.

### Team Member Invitation & Onboarding

As a team administrator, I want to invite team members via email with appropriate role assignments, so that my entire team can collaborate within our shared workspace.

**Workflow:** Admin accesses team management section, enters team member email addresses with role selection (Admin, Member, Viewer), system sends invitation emails with secure signup links, invitees complete registration process and are automatically added to the team workspace.

### Secure Authentication & Session Management

As a team member, I want to securely log in to TaskFlow and maintain my session across browser tabs and visits, so that I can access my team's projects without repeatedly entering credentials.

**Workflow:** User enters email/password on login page, system validates credentials and creates secure session, user gains access to their team dashboard, session persists across browser tabs and remembers user for future visits (with optional "Remember Me" functionality).

## Spec Scope

1. **User Registration System** - Complete user signup flow with email verification and account activation
2. **Multi-tenant Team Creation** - Team workspace creation with unique team identifiers and settings
3. **Secure Authentication** - Email/password login with JWT token management and session persistence
4. **Team Member Management** - Invitation system, role-based access control, and member administration
5. **Password Security** - Secure password hashing, password reset functionality via email verification

## Out of Scope

- Social login integration (Google, GitHub, etc.) - planned for Phase 3
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration - planned for Phase 5
- Two-factor authentication - planned for Phase 5
- Advanced permission granularity beyond basic roles - planned for Phase 4
- User profile customization beyond basic information

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Registration & Login System** - Users can create accounts, verify emails, log in, and maintain secure sessions
2. **Team Workspace Creation** - Team administrators can create team workspaces with unique team identification
3. **Team Member Management Interface** - Admins can invite members, assign roles, and manage team membership through a web interface

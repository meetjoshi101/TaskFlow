## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the TaskFlow todo application, I want to interact with a modern, visually appealing interface that is pleasant to look at and easy to use, so that managing my tasks becomes an enjoyable experience rather than a mundane chore.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I open the TaskFlow application, **When** I view the todo list, **Then** I see a modern, clean interface with attractive visual styling
2. **Given** I am using the application on different screen sizes, **When** I interact with the todo list, **Then** the interface adapts responsively and remains usable
3. **Given** I am viewing tasks in different states (completed, pending, deleted), **When** I look at the interface, **Then** each state is clearly distinguished through appropriate visual styling
4. **Given** I am creating or editing a task, **When** I interact with form elements, **Then** they provide clear visual feedback and are easy to use
5. **Given** I am using the filter and toolbar features, **When** I interact with these components, **Then** they have consistent, modern styling that matches the overall design

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the task list is empty? (Should show an attractive empty state)
- How does the interface handle very long task titles? (Should wrap to maximum 2 lines)
- What visual feedback is provided during loading states?
- How do error states appear in the modernized interface?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display the todo list with modern, visually appealing styling that enhances user experience
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide consistent visual design across all components (task items, input forms, filters, toolbars)
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the "Spring Happiness" color palette (#AF7575 warm rose, #EFD8A1 soft yellow, #BCD693 light green, #AFD7DB pale teal, #3D9CA8 deep teal) for consistent brand theming that is easy on the eyes
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain responsive design that works on tablet (768px+) and desktop (1024px+) screen sizes
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear visual distinction between different task states (completed, pending, deleted)
- **FR-006**: System MUST include hover states and interactive feedback for all clickable elements
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility compliance while implementing modern styling
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide attractive empty states when no tasks are present
- **FR-009**: System MUST use consistent spacing, margins, and layout principles throughout the interface

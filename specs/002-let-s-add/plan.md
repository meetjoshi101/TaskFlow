# Implementation Plan: Modern UI Styling

**Branch**: `002-let-s-add` | **Date**: September 24, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/TaskFlow/specs/002-let-s-add/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Transform TaskFlow's existing todo list interface with modern, visually appealing styling using Tailwind CSS v4.1. Implement the "Spring Happiness" color palette (#AF7575, #EFD8A1, #BCD693, #AFD7DB, #3D9CA8) to create a pleasant, responsive user experience that meets WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards. Focus on clean visual hierarchy, smooth transitions, and consistent branding across all components while maintaining the existing Angular functional architecture.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x, Angular 20+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tailwind CSS v4.1, Angular standalone components  
**Storage**: N/A (styling feature)  
**Testing**: N/A (removed from constitution v4.0.0)  
**Target Platform**: Web (responsive for tablet 768px+ and desktop 1024px+)
**Project Type**: Web frontend (Angular application)  
**Performance Goals**: Smooth animations with variable duration, maintain responsive UI performance  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance, Spring Happiness color palette, max 2-line text wrapping  
**Scale/Scope**: Single-page Angular application with 5 main components (task-list, task-item, task-input, filter-toolbar, deleted-panel)

**Additional Context from User**: We will use Tailwind CSS v4.1 for the styling implementation.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Reference: Constitution v4.0.0**

- [x] **Angular-First Architecture**: All functionality starts with simple standalone Angular components/services ✓ (styling existing components)
- [x] **Simple Implementation**: Start with simplest solution, add complexity only when proven necessary ✓ (CSS-only styling approach)
- [x] **Angular CLI Usage**: All artifacts generated via `ng generate` commands ✓ (no new artifacts needed)
- [x] **Context7 Documentation**: Angular and related library documentation fetched via Context7 MCP ✓ (will research Tailwind CSS v4.1)
- [x] **Operational Excellence**: Observability, versioning, simplicity, accessibility, security addressed ✓ (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance planned)
- [x] **Quality Gates**: Lint errors = build failure ✓ (will maintain)
- [x] **Angular Best Practices**: Standalone components, signals for state, built-in features first ✓ (existing architecture preserved)

# Option 3: Mobile + API (when "iOS/Android" detected)

```

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each UI component → styling enhancement task [P]
- Each contract → implementation validation task
- Each theme element → configuration task [P]
- Responsive design → breakpoint testing tasks
- Accessibility requirements → compliance validation tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Implementation order: Foundation setup → Component styling → Integration testing
- Dependency order: Tailwind setup before component styling, theme configuration before components
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent styling tasks)

**Task Categories**:
1. **Foundation Tasks**: Tailwind CSS installation, PostCSS configuration, theme setup
2. **Component Styling Tasks**: Individual component visual enhancements (can run in parallel)
3. **Integration Tasks**: Responsive design, accessibility validation, cross-browser testing
4. **Validation Tasks**: Performance testing, functionality regression testing

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Task 1-3: Environment setup (Tailwind installation, PostCSS config, theme implementation)
- Task 4-8: Component styling (TaskList, TaskItem, TaskInput, FilterToolbar, DeletedPanel) [P]
- Task 9-12: Responsive design and accessibility implementation
- Task 13-15: Integration testing and validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

**No violations found** - This styling implementation follows constitutional principles:
- Uses Angular standalone components (existing architecture preserved)
- Simple CSS enhancement approach without architectural complexity
- Context7 MCP server used for Tailwind documentation research
- Angular CLI tooling maintained
- Operational excellence addressed through accessibility and performance requirements


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS  
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented (None required - simple styling approach)

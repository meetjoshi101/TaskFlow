2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24
- Q: How should the sidebar behave on mobile/tablet devices? ‚Üí A: Collapsible/hamburger menu that can be toggled
- Q: What type of visual feedback should be shown during page navigation? ‚Üí A: Both loading indicator and active state
- Q: What additional elements should be included in the top bar to provide structure? ‚Üí A: Name plus breadcrumb navigation
- Q: What should happen when there are no deleted items to display on the deleted items page? ‚Üí A: Show empty state message only
- Q: Should users be able to perform management actions on the deleted items page? ‚Üí A: Restore functionality only

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a TaskFlow user, I want to have a clear navigation structure with a top bar displaying the application name and identity, and a sidebar for easy navigation between different sections of the application (active tasks, deleted items management), so that I can efficiently move between different views and understand where I am in the application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on any page in the TaskFlow application, **When** I look at the top of the screen, **Then** I should see a consistent top bar showing the TaskFlow application name and providing visual structure
2. **Given** I am using the TaskFlow application, **When** I look at the left side of the screen, **Then** I should see a sidebar with navigation options for different pages
3. **Given** I am viewing active tasks, **When** I click on the deleted items navigation option in the sidebar, **Then** I should be taken to a dedicated page for managing deleted items
4. **Given** I am on the deleted items page, **When** I click on the todo management navigation option in the sidebar, **Then** I should be taken back to the main task management view
5. **Given** I am navigating between different pages, **When** I use the sidebar navigation, **Then** the current page should be clearly indicated in the navigation

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the sidebar is collapsed or hidden on smaller screens?
- How does the navigation behave when there are no deleted items to manage?
- What visual feedback is provided when navigating between pages?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a persistent top bar across all pages showing the TaskFlow application name
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a sidebar navigation menu that allows users to navigate between different sections
- **FR-003**: System MUST include a dedicated page for deleted items management accessible via sidebar navigation
- **FR-004**: System MUST include a dedicated page for active todo management accessible via sidebar navigation
- **FR-005**: System MUST clearly indicate the current active page/section in the sidebar navigation
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain navigation state when users move between different pages
- **FR-007**: Top bar MUST provide visual structure and identity to help users understand they are in the TaskFlow application
- **FR-008**: Sidebar navigation MUST be consistently accessible from all pages within the application
- **FR-009**: System MUST separate deleted items management from active task management into distinct navigable sections
- **FR-010**: Sidebar MUST be collapsible on mobile/tablet devices using a hamburger menu toggle
- **FR-011**: System MUST show loading indicator during page navigation transitions
- **FR-012**: System MUST visually highlight the currently active page/section in the sidebar navigation
- **FR-013**: Top bar MUST include breadcrumb navigation showing current page context
- **FR-014**: Deleted items page MUST show an empty state message when no deleted items exist
- **FR-015**: Deleted items page MUST provide restore functionality to move deleted items back to active tasks

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Navigation State**: Represents the current active page/section, tracking where the user is in the application
- **Navigation Menu Items**: Individual navigation options in the sidebar (e.g., "Active Tasks", "Deleted Items")
- **Application Identity**: Top bar branding and structural elements that provide consistent application context

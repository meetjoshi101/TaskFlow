# Feature Specification: Create Taskify

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-taskify-team`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Taskflow, a team productivity platform. It should allow users to create projects, add team members, assign tasks, comment and move tasks between boards in Kanban style. In this initial phase for this feature, let's call it 'Create Taskify,' let's have multiple users but the users will be declared ahead of time, predefined. I want five users in two different categories, one product manager and four engineers. Let's create three different sample projects. Let's have the standard Kanban columns for the status of each task, such as 'To Do,' 'In Progress,' 'In Review,' and 'Done.' There will be no login for this application as this is just the very first testing thing to ensure that our basic features are set up. For each task in the UI for a task card, you should be able to change the current status of the task between the different columns in the Kanban work board. You should be able to leave an unlimited number of comments for a particular card. You should be able to, from that task card, assign one of the valid users. When you first launch Taskify, it's going to give you a list of the five users to pick from. There will be no password required. When you click on a user, you go into the main view, which displays the list of projects. When you click on a project, you open the Kanban board for that project. You're going to see the columns. You'll be able to drag and drop cards back and forth between different columns. You will see any cards that are assigned to you, the currently logged in user, in a different color from all the other ones, so you can quickly see yours. You can edit any comments that you make, but you can't edit comments that other people made. You can delete any comments that you made, but you can't delete comments anybody else made."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors (predefined users), actions (create projects, assign tasks, comment, move tasks), data (projects, users, tasks, comments), constraints (no login, comment permissions)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [RESOLVED: User Should be able to create new Project.]
   → [RESOLVED: Each project should have 5-15 tasks randomly distributed across completion stages]
   → [RESOLVED: Commit must be timestamped in readable formate with proper commit message]

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user launches Taskify, selects their name from a list of five predefined users, views available projects, selects a project, and interacts with the Kanban board by creating, assigning, commenting on, and moving tasks between columns. The user can see their assigned tasks highlighted, and can edit/delete only their own comments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** Taskify is launched, **When** a user selects their name, **Then** they see a list of projects.
2. **Given** a project is selected, **When** the Kanban board is displayed, **Then** the user sees all tasks and columns with tasks distributed across all stages.
3. **Given** a project Kanban board, **When** viewed, **Then** there are between 5-15 tasks with at least one task in each column (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done).
4. **Given** a task card, **When** the user changes its status, **Then** the card moves to the selected column.
5. **Given** a task card, **When** the user adds a comment, **Then** the comment appears below the card.
6. **Given** a comment made by the user, **When** the user edits or deletes it, **Then** the change is reflected; **When** the user tries to edit/delete another user's comment, **Then** the action is not allowed.
7. **Given** a task card, **When** the user assigns it to a valid user, **Then** the card is highlighted for that user.
8. **Given** a Kanban board, **When** the user drags a card between columns, **Then** the card's status updates accordingly.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all tasks are assigned to one user?
- How does the system handle simultaneous drag-and-drop actions by multiple users?
- What if a user tries to assign a task to a non-existent user? Assigment should be in dropdown where the correct user list should be present. if user search for the user that does not exisist the ndropdown should display user not present.
- What if a user tries to delete a comment that has already been deleted?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow selection from five predefined users (1 product manager, 4 engineers) on launch.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of three sample projects after user selection.
- **FR-002b**: Each sample project MUST contain between 5-15 tasks, randomly distributed across all completion stages (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done) with at least one task in each stage.
- **FR-003**: System MUST present a Kanban board for each project with columns: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done.
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to create, assign, and move tasks between columns via drag-and-drop.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow unlimited comments per task card.
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to assign tasks to any valid user.
- **FR-007**: System MUST highlight cards assigned to the current user.
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to edit/delete only their own comments.
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent editing/deleting comments made by other users.
- **FR-010**: System MUST not require login or password for access.
- **FR-011**: System MUST display all tasks and comments for each project.
- **FR-012**: System MUST prevent assignment of tasks to non-existent users. show Error message stating that user does not exists.
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle simultaneous actions gracefully. yes, Real time sync required.

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents a predefined team member (attributes: name, role [product manager, engineer])
- **Project**: Represents a collection of tasks (attributes: name, list of 5-15 tasks randomly distributed across completion stages)

- **Comment**: Represents a user note on a task (attributes: author, text, editable/deletable by author only)
- **Kanban Column**: Represents a status category (attributes: name, list of tasks)

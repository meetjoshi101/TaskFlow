# Tasks: Create Taskify

**Input**: Design documents from `/workspaces/TaskFlow/specs/001-create-taskify-team/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## ðŸ“Š Current Status (September 12, 2025)

âœ… **Phase 3.1: Setup - COMPLETED**
- All T001-T006 tasks implemented
- Backend: Node.js + Express + SQLite structure created
- Frontend: Angular 20 project initialized with CDK
- Linting and formatting tools configured for both

âœ… **Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) - COMPLETED**

- T007-T020: Contract and integration tests implemented and passing
- All 53 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Backend implementation completed and validated

ðŸ”„ **Next Phase: Phase 3.4 - Integration & Frontend**

- T042-T050: Frontend components and services
- T051-T057: Database integration, middleware, and real-time features
- Ready for full-stack development and testing

## Execution Flow (main)

```bash
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   â†’ Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   â†’ data-model.md: Extract entities â†’ model tasks
   â†’ contracts/: Each file â†’ contract test task
   â†’ research.md: Extract decisions â†’ setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   â†’ Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   â†’ Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   â†’ Core: models, services, CLI commands
   â†’ Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   â†’ Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   â†’ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   â†’ All contracts have tests?
   â†’ All entities have models?
   â†’ All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Dependencies

- Tests (T007-T020) âœ… **COMPLETED** and passing (100% success rate)
- Models (T021-T025) âœ… **COMPLETED** before services (T026-T029)
- Services âœ… **COMPLETED** before API endpoints (T030-T040)
- Backend setup (T001-T006) âœ… **COMPLETED** before tests
- Frontend components depend on API service (T047)
- Real-time features (T053) after basic API

## Parallel Example

```bash
# Launch T007-T020 together:
Task: "Contract test GET /api/users in backend/tests/contract/test_users_get.js"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/projects in backend/tests/contract/test_projects_get.js"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/projects in backend/tests/contract/test_projects_post.js"
...
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing

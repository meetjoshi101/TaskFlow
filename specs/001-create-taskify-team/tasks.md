- Frontend: Angular 20 project initialized with CDK
- Linting and formatting tools configured for both

✅ **Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) - COMPLETED**
- T007-T020: Contract and integration tests implemented and passing
- All 53 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Backend implementation completed and validated

✅ **Phase 3.3: Frontend Components - COMPLETED**
- T042-T050: All frontend components and services implemented
- User selector with 5 predefined users (1 PM, 4 engineers)
- Project list and navigation components
- Kanban board with Angular CDK drag-and-drop functionality
- Task card and comment components with proper permissions
- API service and WebSocket service for real-time updates
- Complete Angular application structure with routing
- Frontend builds successfully and is ready for integration

🔄 **Next Phase: Phase 3.4 - Integration & Database**

- Connect frontend to backend API endpoints
- Implement CORS, authentication, and error handling middleware
- Add Socket.io real-time communication
- Seed database with sample data for testing
- Ready for full-stack integration and testing

## Execution Flow (main)

```bash
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

Task: "Contract test GET /api/users in backend/tests/contract/test_users_get.js"
Task: "Contract test GET /api/projects in backend/tests/contract/test_projects_get.js"
Task: "Contract test POST /api/projects in backend/tests/contract/test_projects_post.js"
...
```

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing

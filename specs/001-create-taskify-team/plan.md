# Implementation Plan: Create Taskify

**Branch**: `001-create-taskify-team` | **Date**: September 12, 2025 | **Spec**: /workspaces/TaskFlow/specs/001-create-taskify-team/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/workspaces/TaskFlow/specs/001-create-taskify-team/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Develop Taskflow, a team productivity platform with Kanban boards. Backend: Node.js Express with SQLite. Frontend: Angular V20 with drag-and-drop task boards and real-time updates. REST API for projects, tasks, and notifications.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Node.js (backend), Angular 20 (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Express, SQLite3, Angular, Angular CDK, Socket.io  
**Storage**: SQLite  
**Testing**: Jest (backend), Jasmine/Karma (frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Web browser
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: Low latency for real-time updates  
**Constraints**: Drag-and-drop functionality, real-time synchronization  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 predefined users, 3 sample projects, 5-15 tasks per project

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 2 (backend, frontend)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? N/A for web app
- Libraries listed: backend API library, frontend components library
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: Planned

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? Unified
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 1.0.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research Node.js Express REST API best practices
   - Research SQLite integration with Node.js
   - Research Angular 20 drag-and-drop with CDK
   - Research real-time updates with Socket.io

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research Express.js best practices for REST API"
   Task: "Research SQLite with Node.js"
   Task: "Research Angular drag-and-drop"
   Task: "Research Socket.io for real-time updates"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: Use Express for backend
   - Rationale: Lightweight, widely used
   - Alternatives considered: Fastify, Koa

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User: id, name, role
   - Project: id, name, tasks
   - Task: id, title, description, assignedUser, status, comments
   - Comment: id, author, text, taskId

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Projects API: GET /api/projects, POST /api/projects
   - Tasks API: GET /api/projects/:id/tasks, POST /api/projects/:id/tasks, PUT /api/tasks/:id/status
   - Notifications API: GET /api/notifications
   - Output OpenAPI schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - User selection scenario
   - Project view scenario
   - Task management scenario

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for GitHub Copilot
   - Output to .github/copilot-instructions.md

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - but per prompt, generate tasks.md*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |

**Feature Branch**: `001-taskflow-n-n`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Taskflow PRD: core client-side work management app for Goals, Portfolios, Projects, Tasks, Sections; IndexedDB-first persistence; many-to-many relations; soft-archive semantics; configurable goal depth; Angular frontend." 

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no low-level APIs or internal file/layout details)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders and product managers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Completed below
- **Optional sections**: Included when relevant

### Constitution Compliance (mandatory)
This feature follows the TaskFlow project principles: strict TypeScript and signal-first state (client-only), accessibility-first UX, and idempotent client operations. Performance targets: UI interactions (create, link, reorder) should complete within 100ms on a typical modern laptop for lists up to 200 items. Testing standards: unit tests for state transformations and integration tests for snapshot persistence. No deviations from constitution observed.

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### Primary User Story
As a knowledge worker, I want to model strategic Goals and organize Projects and Tasks across flexible Portfolios so I can plan work at multiple levels and maintain cross-project task membership without destructive deletes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given an empty workspace, When the user creates a Goal with a title and description, Then the Goal appears in the Goal tree and can be expanded to show child entities.
2. Given a Task that belongs to Project A, When the user links it to Project B, Then the Task's project membership includes both A and B and both Project pages list the Task.
3. Given a Project with sections and tasks, When the user reorders tasks (keyboard or drag), Then the new order persists in the client snapshot and is visible after reload/import.
4. Given ParentGoal at max depth (default 3), When the user attempts to add another sub-goal beyond configured max depth, Then the UI prevents the action and shows a validation message.
5. Given a parent entity is archived, When a child remains active, Then the child shows an orphan indicator and is still accessible; archiving parent does not automatically archive children.

### Edge Cases
- Creating circular goal references must be rejected (detect via DFS on attempted link).  
- Linking a Task to a non-existent Project must fail validation and not mutate state.  
- Re-applying the same link (task‚Üîproject or project‚Üîportfolio) is a no-op (idempotent).  
- Restoring from a corrupted or older snapshot must report migration version mismatch and refuse until manual confirmation.

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow creating, reading, updating, and archiving (soft-delete) Goals, Portfolios, Projects, Tasks, and TaskSections.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce configurable max depth for sub-goals (default = 3) and prevent creation beyond the limit.
- **FR-003**: System MUST prevent circular goal nesting; link attempts creating cycles MUST be rejected with a clear error.
- **FR-004**: System MUST support many-to-many linking: Tasks ‚Üî Projects and Projects ‚Üî Portfolios. Linking/unlinking operations MUST be idempotent.
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow Tasks to have subtasks and TaskSections; subtasks inherit no automatic project links unless explicitly added.
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist client state as the canonical runtime graph in-memory and provide durable snapshots (IndexedDB primary, localStorage fallback).
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow adding, removing, and reordering TaskSections within a Project, and reordering Tasks within a Section. Orders MUST be persisted in snapshots.
- **FR-008**: System MUST surface orphan indicators when an entity has no active parent(s) due to archiving.
- **FR-009**: System MUST reject invalid moves (e.g., inserting a Task into a non-existent Section) with validation errors.
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide keyboard-accessible drag-and-drop reordering with ARIA announcements for DnD operations.

*Notes on ambiguous items:* No significant ambiguities in the PRD; operational specifics (e.g., exact snapshot schema versioning format, retention window for snapshots, or visual copy for orphan indicator) are left for implementation decisions. Marking UI copy as implementation detail.

### Key Entities
- **Goal**: Root strategic intent. Attributes: `id`, `title`, `description?`, `parentGoalId?`, `childIds[]`, `status`, timestamps, `maxDepth?` (config). Behavior: can contain any child work type; nesting limited by `maxDepth` and cycles prevented.
- **Portfolio**: Grouping for Projects. Attributes: `id`, `title`, `goalIds[]`, `projectIds[]`, status, timestamps.
- **Project**: Deliverable container. Attributes: `id`, `title`, `portfolioIds[]`, `taskIds[]`, `sectionIds[]`, status, timestamps.
- **TaskSection**: Logical grouping within a Project. Attributes: `id`, `projectId`, `taskIds[]`, `position?`.
- **Task**: Actionable unit. Attributes: `id`, `title`, `description?`, `projectIds[]`, `parentTaskId?`, `subtaskIds[]`, `sectionId?`, `position?`, status, timestamps.

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No low-level implementation details (frameworks are noted in PRD but spec focuses on what/why)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain  
  - Rationale: PRD provided comprehensive functional definitions; remaining details (snapshot schema version format, exact UI copy) are implementation-level and will be handled in planning.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous for acceptance tests listed above
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (see Acceptance Criteria in PRD)
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (MVP excludes auth, realtime, integrations)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (IndexedDB-first persistence, Angular client)

---

## Execution Status
- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked (none critical)
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [ ] Review checklist passed (awaiting stakeholder review)

---

## Next Steps / Planning Handoff (recommended)
1. Planning session to convert FRs into tickets (sprint-sized): prioritize M1 (data model + GoalTree + CRUD flows).  
2. Create a snapshot schema migration plan and a small import/export test harness.  
3. Design accessibility acceptance tests for keyboard DnD and ARIA announcements.  
4. Prepare seeded demo data to exercise many-to-many scenarios and orphan states.

# Feature Specification: Simple Client-Side To-Do List

**Feature Branch**: `001-taskflow-leate-create`  
**Created**: 2025-09-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Taskflow: let me create simple todo list, no backend, data will be stored in browser locally, focus on main features only exclude the user management and authentication."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
  → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
  → Identify: actors (single end user), actions (create, view, manage tasks), data (tasks stored locally), constraints (no backend, no auth)
3. For each unclear aspect:
  → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
  → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
  → Each requirement must be testable
  → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (tasks)
7. Run Review Checklist
  → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
  → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., due dates, priorities), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas** (many apply here):

- Enhancements (priorities, due dates, categories)
- Data retention and deletion behavior
- Maximum limits (task count, title length)
- Accessibility expectations (keyboard, screen reader)
- Performance targets (load time, max tasks)
- Multi-tab consistency

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to create and manage a simple list of tasks directly in my browser so that I can remember and track items to complete without needing to sign up or rely on a network connection.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user opens the application with no existing tasks, **When** they add a task with a non-empty title, **Then** the task appears in the task list as active (not completed).
2. **Given** a task exists and is visible, **When** the user marks it as completed, **Then** its status changes to completed and it remains listed (visually differentiated) unless filtered out.
3. **Given** one or more tasks exist, **When** the user reloads the page, **Then** previously created tasks persist in the list with their completion statuses.
4. **Given** a task exists, **When** the user deletes it, **Then** it is removed from the visible list and no longer present after a page reload.
5. **Given** multiple tasks with different completion states exist, **When** the user selects a view filter (All / Active / Completed), **Then** only tasks matching that state appear.

### Edge Cases

- Creating a task with only whitespace in the title → Trim input; if empty after trim, reject and do not create a task.
- Very long task title (e.g., >200 characters) → Enforce maximum of 140 characters (reject above limit with non-destructive message).
- Deleting the last remaining task → Show empty state message: "No tasks yet – add your first task."
- Marking a completed task back to active → Task retains its original creation-based position (stable ordering by creation time ascending).
- Opening the app in two browser tabs and editing tasks → Changes made in one tab appear in another only after that tab is refreshed (no real-time multi-tab sync requirement).
- Clearing browser site data → All tasks permanently removed (expected within local-only scope).
- Rapidly adding many tasks (e.g., 500) → System remains responsive; rendering initial list of up to 500 tasks completes within ~1 second on a typical modern device.
- Accessibility: All core actions (add, edit, toggle complete, delete, clear completed, filter) are operable via keyboard alone; focus order logical; completed state conveyed via text and not color alone; color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA for text.

## Assumptions & Decisions (Derived)

- Single user context only; no profiles or authentication.
- Local persistence uses browser-provided storage (conceptual; mechanism unspecified) and is device+browser specific.
- Task filtering (All / Active / Completed) is in scope for initial release.
- Inline title editing is supported (single interaction to enter edit mode, then save or cancel).
- Bulk "Clear Completed" action included (optional convenience categorized as SHOULD, not MUST).
- Duplicate task titles are allowed; no uniqueness constraint enforced.
- Ordering rule: tasks displayed in ascending order of creation (oldest at top, newest at bottom); no manual reordering.
- Performance target: Up to 500 tasks without perceptible lag (initial render <1s typical device).
- Title length: 1–140 characters after trimming; leading/trailing whitespace removed; internal whitespace preserved.
- Timestamps exist conceptually for ordering; they are not required to be displayed to the user.
- Multi-tab live synchronization beyond manual refresh is out of scope.
- Responsiveness: Usable on viewport widths ≥320px (mobile), with layout adapting at ~768px (tablet) and ~1024px (desktop).
- Accessibility baseline: Keyboard operability, focus visibility, non-color state indicators, text contrast meeting WCAG AA.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow the user to add a new task with a title 1–140 characters after trimming leading/trailing whitespace; empty or over-length submissions are rejected without creating a task.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST display a list of all existing tasks in ascending creation order (oldest first).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow the user to mark a task as completed and to revert a completed task to active state.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow the user to delete an existing task; deletion immediately removes it from the list and persistence layer.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST persist tasks locally so they remain available after a browser page reload on the same device and browser (no remote or cross-device sync).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST function without network connectivity after initial load for all core actions (add, view, toggle complete, edit, delete, filter, clear completed).
- **FR-007**: The system MUST exclude user accounts, user management flows, and authentication steps.
- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD visually and textually differentiate completed vs active tasks using more than color alone (e.g., text decoration plus status label) while preserving readability.
- **FR-009**: The system SHOULD allow inline editing of a task title in place via a single user action (e.g., initiating edit and confirming or cancelling) while preserving ordering.
- **FR-010**: The system SHOULD provide a bulk action to remove all completed tasks in one step after user confirmation.
- **FR-011**: The system SHOULD display task counts: total, active, and completed, updating in real time with changes.
- **FR-012**: The system SHOULD allow filtering tasks by status: All, Active, Completed; selected filter persists during the session (until reload).
- **FR-013**: The system MUST maintain a consistent ordering rule (creation time ascending) regardless of completion status changes.
- **FR-014**: The system SHOULD display the empty state message "No tasks yet – add your first task." when no tasks exist.
- **FR-015**: The system MUST allow duplicate task titles; no uniqueness constraint is enforced.
- **FR-016**: The system MUST not expose any user-identifiable data beyond task titles stored locally.
- **FR-017**: The system SHOULD adapt layout for viewport widths ≥320px (mobile), ≥768px (tablet adjustments), and ≥1024px (desktop) without horizontal scrolling for core content.
- **FR-018**: The system SHOULD handle up to 500 tasks while keeping initial render and filter operations perceptibly responsive (target: initial list render under ~1 second on a typical modern device).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Task**: A user-defined to-do item. Attributes: identifier (unique within local dataset), title (user-entered text), completion status (active|completed), creation timestamp (used for ordering), optional last modified indicator (if edited), implicit ordering index derived from creation sequence; no manual reordering.
- **Task Collection**: Conceptual grouping of all tasks for the single user context within one browser profile; persisted locally; no cross-profile or cross-device synchronization.
